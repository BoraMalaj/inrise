# INRISE: The Token of Shared Light and Spiritual Unity

Peace, Love, Light... and the Rise. 🕊️🔥 Never walk alone. ❤️

Born on Easter Sunday, INRISE is a Solana-based token created to illuminate the shared truths of all world religions. It powers a decentralized marketplace where anyone can exchange sacred books, artifacts, and cultural treasures — creating bridges of understanding between faiths.

Our mission? To reveal the good at the core of every belief, and help humanity rise beyond differences.

INRISE is not about one religion — it’s about the human journey toward Light, Peace, and Love.

✨ One path. One light. One rise. ✨

INRISE – Never Walk Alone. 🕊️
